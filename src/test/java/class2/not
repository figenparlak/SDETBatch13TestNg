Assertions:
we are not using if else condition because even if the test case fails (i.e the conditon doesnt pass in if)
the testNG will still show it has passed
in order to overcome that we use
Assertions from testNG
the library is Assert
and we call differnet types of assertions from it
first assertion that we learned is
1.Assert.AssertEquals(String , String)
it comapres two strings if they are equal test case passed else fails.
2.Assert.AssetTrue(boolean)-->if the boolean is True the Assertion will pass
								if the boolean is false the assertion will fail
1.HardAssertions
As soon as any assertion FAIlS it doesnt check for other assertions , marks the test as failed and quits
Assert.Assertequals(Expected value,Actual Value)-->if they are equal your test case will pass
`												--> if they are not equal your test case is going to FAIL
2.SoftAssertions:
Soft asseertion will execute all assertions that are there despite of the fact that they FAIL or PASS
and once it has evaluated them all then it will mark the test case as
Failed or Passed
(it marks it failed even if one assertion has failed)
The advantage of using soft asssert is that we can
see what errors we are having in other assertions that we make in the same test case
but we cant see them if we use hardassertion as IT WILL EXIT AS SOON AS THE FIRST ASSERTION FAILS
method to implement:
1. declare the instance
softAssert soft =new softAssert();
2.make assertions
soft.assertEquals();
3. at the end of makiing all assertions
you must do
soft.assertALL()
this evalutes weather the test case has to be marked passed or failed
